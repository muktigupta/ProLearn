        <p>This is a web base online examination quiz system multiple-choice
question examination system, named Online examination Quiz System (OEQS), 
for assessing students. It is a system by which students can
appear in a quiz from  anywhere of the world where there is 
no interaction between pencil   and paper rather interaction between 
computer and human being. Teachers can use the oeqs for evaluating students effectively,
efficiently and perfectly.  Any university, college, school or educational institute can 
use this system for their organization to take quizzes. Today it is the more  efficient and 
effective methods of assessing distant students. One of the main benefits of our system is automated marking, 
that is, teachers do not need to check the answer script as they do in manual quiz. </p>
